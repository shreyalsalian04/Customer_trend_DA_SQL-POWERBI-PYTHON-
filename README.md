How can the company leverage consumer shopping data to identify trends, improve customer engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?

# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior to understand purchasing patterns, discount usage, and product preferences. The analysis is done using SQL, Python, and Power BI to extract insights and visualize trends.

## Objective

- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – data cleaning and analysis  
- Power BI – dashboard creation and visualization  

## Project Files
- SQL queries used for analysis  
- Power BI dashboard file  
- Python used for cleaning  

## Key Insights
- Customers who used discounts often spent more than the average purchase amount
- Purchase behavior varies across age groups and gender
